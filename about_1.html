       <p>To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighbourhoods, who have an interest in learning and playing soccer, with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to the game of soccer, specifically those skills around team cooperation and good sportmanship.</p>
      <h3>Vision</h3> 
       <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong, well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the building of character, self-discipline, and leadership.</p>
      <h3>General Information</h3>
